Place tiles to create 5 tile hands (one pair and one set, with the set either being a sequence or three of a kind) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The order of the tiles doesn't matter. Every now and then a bomb piece will spawn that will let you clear the whole board of one suit.
Have fun, wan wan!
